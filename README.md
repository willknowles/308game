TITLE: TYPING INVASION 300

GENRE: Top Down Scrolling Shooter(ish)

MECHANICS/GOAL: Essentially, words fall down from the sky and if you type the word, it explodes in a blaze of glory. You have a health bar that goes down by a little bit if you make a typo, and that goes down by a lot if you let a word fall all the way to the bottom. You get to the next level by surviving a certain amount of time. Words get longer/harder as you progress

BOSS FIGHT: Every few levels you encounter a "boss fight" level wherein you not only do words fall down that you can type and destroy, but also invulnerable missiles fall down that will damage you on impact. You control your character with the arrow keys, and it is up to you to decide how to avoid the missiles while still typing: type with one hand and arrow with the other, attempt to type a lot of words until you have to move, or try to do both at the same time.
